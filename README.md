Hold-em-Home-Game
=================

The goal of the project was to program a playable game from scratch in less than one week, using sounds & sprites gathered online. I succeeded and [committed](https://github.com/stevensoftware52/Hold-em-Home-Game/commit/941badee7bc1b917c5ce00a3e5a1c3058002a56b) a playable version four days after I started working on the project on March 11, 2014.

The game is Texas Hold'em, using play-money. Players and their friends can create accounts on their own server, have their own avatar, taunt fellow players with a matching sound effect, and play music via chat box commands "/avatar", "/taunt", "/music". A database is not used as the server is intended to be easy to use on anyone's home computer. Accounts and their information are saved to text files.

The source code, table sprite, and chat box textures are owned by me.

_I claim no ownership over the other images, or any sounds, used in this freeware, nor any ownership of hge.dll or bass.dll. This project was strictly created for fun as a self learning project. Visit http://hge.relishgames.com/ for more information on the DirectX 8 engine used._
